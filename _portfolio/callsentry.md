**Summary:** A system-level Android application that balances strict communication privacy with reliable emergency contact routing.

*   **Problem:** Existing call blockers either let spam through or rigidly block everything, lacking fine-grained control to ensure critical emergency calls can bypass filters safely.
*   **Solution:** Built a native Android application using Kotlin to provide offline, privacy-first call and SMS filtering. Architected a custom background service using Broadcast Receivers and system-level permissions to intercept and evaluate incoming calls against secure local Whitelists and Blocklists.
*   **Tech Stack:** `Kotlin`, `Jetpack Compose`, `MVVM Architecture`, `Room Database`, `Android Telephony System APIs`

*   **What I learned:** Deepened my understanding of Android system-level APIs, managed complex background service lifecycles securely, and implemented strict MVVM separation for asynchronous data flows.
