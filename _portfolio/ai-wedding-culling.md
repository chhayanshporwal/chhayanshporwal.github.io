**Summary:** An automated REST pipeline that evaluates massive bursts of wedding photos to filter out bad shots and group duplicates.

*   **Problem:** Wedding photographers spend countless hours manually culling thousands of burst shots, wasting time identifying blurry images, closed eyes, and redundant frames.
*   **Solution:** Deployed an automated pipeline that evaluates images using facial landmark detection to reject poor photos (motion blur, closed eyes). It also utilizes embedding clustering to group near-duplicate burst shots and specialized models to preserve images of enrolled VIPs.
*   **Tech Stack:** `Python`, `FastAPI`, `YOLOv8n`, `MediaPipe FaceMesh`, `CLIP ViT-L/14`, `OpenCV`, `MTCNN`

*   **What I learned:** Mastered chaining multiple heavy computer vision models in a FastAPI backend and handling complex vector mathematics (L2 distance) for accurate semantic image clustering.
