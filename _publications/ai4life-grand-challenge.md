**Summary:** A competitive research project focused on developing self-supervised machine learning models to denoise high-resolution biological calcium imaging — achieving **Global Rank 2**.

*   **Problem:** High-resolution biological calcium imaging suffers from severe noise, and acquiring clean "ground truth" data for supervised machine learning is practically impossible in this domain.
*   **Solution:** Built a self-supervised Noise2Void (N2V) model utilizing PyTorch for denoising high-resolution 3D calcium imaging data. The model extracts clean signals while strictly preserving the spatial and temporal integrity of the biological data. Evaluated efficacy using stSNR, PSNR, and SI-PSNR metrics.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, 3D Noise2Void, Docker, NumPy, SciPy.
*   **Outcome:** Successfully containerized the final pipeline via Docker for deployment and evaluation on the Grand Challenge platform. Achieved **Global Rank 2** by ensuring robust generalization across unseen datasets.
